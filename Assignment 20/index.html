    Mapbox<br>

  The lecture video bascially talked about some function of Mapbox and how we could manage the map like we want. Before watch the lexture, I have experiencde with Mapbox before for some of my projects but don't know how to save it. The way i used before is doing screenshot. Now i understand more about map box and how to use in correctly way. <br><br>
  When thinking about what type of map I would want to create is more about my project last year. While we try to look for some geology information and surroundind context, it took us forever to find. With help of mapbox, I think it will help me make the perfect context map, especailly for some diagrams like transportation, contour line layout and hydrology information.<br><br>
